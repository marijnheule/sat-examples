Changes in version 1.2.0
------------------------

 BUG     BUG    BUG
INTRO | FIXED | DESCRIPTION

1.0.0   1.2.0   HSAT could pick the wrong variable
1.1.0   1.2.0   Novelty++ Weighted [alg novelty++ -w] called the wrong trigger / wouldn't execute
1.1.0   1.2.0   Schoening's Algorithm [-alg crwalk -v schoening] wasn't restarting properly
1.0.0   1.2.0   (minor) each run of RoTS would start with tabu tenure from previous run

* new feature: Now support runs of length 2^64

* MAJOR change to weighted MAX-SAT: .wcnf files now only support 64-bit integers, not floating point values (see sample.wcnf)

* new algorithm: Sparrow (-alg sparrow) & Sparrow 2011 (-alg sparrow -v sat11)

* new algorithm: VW2/2005 (-alg vw2 -v 2005) -- vw2 variant from the SAT 2005 Competition

* new algorithm: Captain Jack (-alg jack) presented at SAT 2011

* new algorithm: Lovasz-Local-Lemma Random Walk: (-alg LLLWalk) [STOC 09] suggested by Dimitris Achlioptas

* changed parameter behaviour: probability parameters are now always between 0..1 or a ratio (eg: 70 100)
                               so to specify a 90% probability, use -paramname 0.9 or -paramname 90 100

* changed algorithms: G2WSAT (and adaptG2WSAT) are now more generalized with parameters to control behaviour

* new option: -abstime starts timer immediately on startup instead of after initialization
* new option: -systime includes system time (not just user time) in time calculations [unix only]
* new option: -timeres checks for timeouts every N steps instead of every step

* new option: -rcsv: prints reports in a .csv compatible mode
* new option: -q turns off the default reports (-r out) and (-r stats)

* new options: -earlysteps -earlyqual: If after -earlysteps steps, the quality is greater than -earlyqual, terminate
* new options: -strikes: Terminate all runs after -strikes unsuccessful runs

* new report: vw2weights
* new report: ParamILS (-r paramils) see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/ParamILS/

* code cleanup: Numerous code cleanups to make it more c++ friendly
                Numerous code cleanups to make it both 32-bit & 64 bit compatible
                Moved all weighted algorithm variants to weighted.c
                Current Software Versions are now in ubcsat-version.c
                Made the makefile a little cleaner
                Made it clearer output for -filesol uses the output from -r uniquesol (not from -r solution, which has an extra column)

------------------------
Changes in version 1.1.0
------------------------

 BUG     BUG    BUG
INTRO | FIXED | DESCRIPTION

1.0.0   1.1.0   Stats & RTD reports can cause crash when no (-r out) specified with a steps column
1.0.0   1.1.0   RTDs with search steps > 2^31 weren't sorted properly: (un)signed int issue
1.0.0   1.1.0   The RTD report could be incorrect if non -cutoff termination is used (-timeout, -noimprove) and <100% success
1.0.0   1.1.0   Wrong heuristic trigger for weighted adaptive nov+ [-alg adaptnovelty+ -w]
1.0.0   1.1.0   Score miscalculation in [-alg novelty(+) -w] and [-alg walksat-tabu -w]
1.0.0   1.1.0   Std. Deviation statistic miscalculation for row stats (not col. stats)
1.0.0   1.1.0   Some stats (example: VarFlipCounts) would only count from last restart
